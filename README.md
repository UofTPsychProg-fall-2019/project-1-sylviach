The purpose of this study is to have individuals evaluate the valence of different characteristics 
in terms of positivity and negativity.

A self-developed questionnaire of 72 items was used in the present study. These 72 items
described two varieties in three domains of characteristic: prosocial (Helpful and Generous),
social (Considerate and Prestigious), and non-social (Attractive and Intelligent). Half items
described the positive characteristics (e.g., helpful, considerate, attractive), and half the
corresponding negative characteristics (e.g., unhelpful, inconsiderate, unattractive). Therefore,
for each characteristic there were six positive items and six negative items (see Appendix for the
full list of items). The half of the characters depicted in the items were males the half were
females. Pairs of characters were gender matched.

Participants were asked to rate valence of each item on a 7-point scale (i.e., “How
positive or negative is the characteristic described here?”) from “very negative” to “very
positive”, and 4 means “neutral”.
